I am planning to build a service which hosts the important locations in my campus
all the locations are present in the @exported folder
and 
the service shld be built in a way so that
other people can just scan a QR code and connect to my service over the internet

now it shld look like this
there are 6 blocks
Block 1 
Block 2
Block 3
Block 4
Block 5
Block 6
Architecture Block
DevDan Block
and The Path from the Main Gate to Block 1
and inside exported/outside
there is OpenAuditorium and StudentSquare

I want it all to be present in a menu kinda thingy

menu:
shld not be the normal big list
instead
aestheically with a dynamic transclusecnt back like it be like a scroll kinda menu
so that it doesnt take up much space

and whenever i hover over the menu option you need to show the entrace of that particular block
photos of which i am yet to upload

Viewer:
now the place where we view the photo
let there be a on screen input which is clickable up down left right buttons to turn in that direction
in addition to that
we shld be able to move around with the mouse, arrow keys and wasd

always display the title of the image alone on the top since that is the name of the location
again display title with a frosted window back

In the top right let there be a logo which is a png image i am yet to upload which belomgs to my university

in the middle right and left
let there be buttons which allow me to move between location within the same block (visible to u as photos within the same folder)

Bottom right 
let there be an information button
which will show the information in text and hyperlink which i will give later



Let the UI be very clutter free
and leave as much space as possible free screen estate so that pics are visible but at the same time no button is inaccessible (hide them while user is interacting or its playing on its own)

when no one interacts 
cycle thru the photos and manuever the photo to "show around" the photo

use the @thumbnail folder to load them faster
and use manifest json to see which thumbnail relates to which photo address
give me any extra features that can be added to each of this
